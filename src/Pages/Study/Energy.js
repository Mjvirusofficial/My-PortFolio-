            <p>Energy is a ability to do work, means any work which is possible by the help of that thing that is known as energy.....According to the law of conservation of energy that energy can not be created or destroyed its only transform in one object to another or one form to another</p>
            <p>The S.I Unit if energy is joule, which is the energy transfermed to an object by the work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of a newton</p>
            <h1 className='heading'><u>There are major two types of energy:-</u></h1>
            <p><b>1.Potential or stored energy.</b></p>
            <p>Potential energy is the energy held by an object because of its position relative to other objects, stresses within itself, its electric charge, or other factors</p>
            <p>A rock sitting on the edge of a cliff. If the rock falls, the potential energy will be converted to kinetic energy, as the rock will be moving.</p>
            <p><b>2.Kinetic or working energy.</b></p>
